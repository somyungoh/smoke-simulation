# Smoke Simulation
A basic 2D smoke simulation

This project ia a coursework of Real-time Fluid Simulation(VIZA 679), Texas A&M University.

Techniques include:
- Semi-Lagrangian advection
- BFECC advection
- Modified MacCormack advection
- Forcing via gravity and bouyancy
- Gauss-Seidel solution of incompressibility
- Forcing via injection of density and divergence
- Characteristic Map
